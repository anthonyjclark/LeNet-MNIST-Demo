# LeNet-MNIST-Demo

A Recreation of Yann Lecun's LeNet-5 MNIST Demonstration. The original: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/

Animation produced by this Jupyter notebook: https://gfycat.com/affectionatememorablegreyhounddog-artificial-intelligence-neural-networks

This Jupyter Notebook creates and trains a LeNet-5 CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The animation is then generated by running the model on many input frames and saving the layer outputs of each frame.
